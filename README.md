## About the Project
The files within this repository are used in addition to the PDF submitted. The report aims to solve if BigQuery can help us predict the most successful teams in the NBA for the 2022-2023 season based off Elo ratings and RAPTOR scores. By using a csv file and performing data cleaning using Juypter Notebook, we created a new csv file which was downloaded into BigQuery and used for analysis.
